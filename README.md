# Canada Freight Transportation Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI report that analyzes the freight transportation patterns in Canada using official datasets from Statistics Canada.

## Data Sources

The data sources used for this project are:

- [Road Network File]: This dataset provides the geographic information of the road network in Canada, including the road name, type, length, and direction.
- [Canadian Freight Analysis Framework]: This dataset provides the information of the freight flows in Canada by mode, province, commodity, and value for the years 2012 to 2017.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation steps include:

- Importing the datasets into Power BI Desktop using the Get Data option.
- Applying data cleansing and transformation techniques using Power Query Editor, such as removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, changing data types, and creating custom columns.
- Creating a data model that links the tables from the two datasets using a common key (province code) and defining measures and calculations using DAX formulas.

## Data Visualization

The data visualization steps include:

- Designing a report layout that consists of four pages: Overview, Mode, Province, and Commodity.
- Using custom visuals such as ArcGIS Maps, Synoptic Panel, and Chiclet Slicer to enhance the user experience and interactivity of the report.
- Using bookmarks to create scenarios and comparisons of different freight flows and values across Canada.
- Using drillthrough and tooltips to enable the user to access more details and information on a specific mode, province, or commodity.
- Using slicers and filters to allow the user to customize the report according to their preferences and needs.

## Data Publishing and Sharing

The data publishing and sharing steps include:

- Publishing the report to Power BI Service using the Publish option in Power BI Desktop.
- Creating a dashboard that summarizes the main findings and insights from the report using the Pin option in Power BI Service.
- Sharing the report and dashboard online with other users and stakeholders using Power BI Service features such as Publish to web, Share, Embed, and Subscribe.

## Data Analysis and Recommendations

The data analysis and recommendations steps include:

- Analyzing the data and identifying the trends, patterns, and outliers in the freight transportation in Canada.
- Providing recommendations for improving the efficiency and sustainability of freight transportation in Canada based on the data analysis.
